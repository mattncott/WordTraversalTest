Use an application interface to allow for it to seamlessly change GUI further down the line

Dictionary Interface to allow for database, file, JSON, etc

We are ONLY interpreting 4 letter words. So we can remove EVERY word longer from the list straight away.

// It will account for not alphabetical but could be slow with large lists
List<string> Recursive(){
	// Divide and conquer the list
	For(List){
		If step 1 find all words with 2 similarities
		2 find all 3 similarities
		until length of string - 1 similarities
	}
}



Problems arisen from unit testing:

Letters out of order 
Capital letters
